// An overlay to see access saved and sample programs
/* Theory of operation
  I core challenge is how to come up with simple/meaningful identifers for the
  many programs authored. The programs are pictures so the first approximation
  is to use picture.

  Hypothesis - programs come in two comon forms:
  >  adhoc, simple demos, easy to remake, standalone
  >  more thoght out parts for a bigger plan.

  For the adhoc simple test, the ide is to treat these a bit more like
  photographs. There is no for a name. The program its self is the identifier
  If a user can thumb through recent programs that is simple than having to make
  up a name for each one. Most programs.



  For the work sheet. Two key operation
  <new> save the current one and show a new sheet.
  <clear> wipe the current workspace.
  <snapshot> take a picture of the current work and let me continue woring.
   this fit the photograph model.

  <record> future perhasp alwasy on, let you roll back any time you want.
